A simple and economical way of finding all eigenvalues and corresponding vectors!

The essence of the Danilevsky method is to bring the characteristic determinant of the matrix to the so-called normal form of Frobenius and its timetable, in the further, on the elements of the first line.
As a result, we obtain a characteristic polynomial of degree n, the coefficients for which unknown elements are the first line of the Frobenius matrix.
